# cqrs-dotnet

CQRS is interpreted differently by various developers. Some understand it as the separation of requests into commands (writes) and queries (reads), often managed via a mediator within the context of a single database.

Others take it further by separating the read and write operations into distinct databases — a write database that stores the source data, and a read database optimized for queries with pre-processed, read-ready data. The latter approach is more complex and is often used in larger systems. This repository focuses on implementing CQRS within these contexts, as demonstrated in my related project.

### Modeling the System

We model a social media system where I implemented two main features:

1. **Posts functionality** — This is a highly demanded feature with frequent and complex read and write operations.

   * **Write operations** involve processing information and writing to multiple tables.
   * **Read operations** require querying many tables with complex joins.
   * A key challenge is the uneven load: about 90-95% of users only perform read operations, while writes are much less frequent.
   * The system also supports a very large number of users.

   In this context, applying CQRS is beneficial to separate and optimize reads and writes independently.

2. **Profiles functionality** — Users access profiles less often, and profile updates have simple and fast logic.

   * This is an example where applying CQRS is unnecessary and can be considered overkill.

Later, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in detail.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### 1. **CQRS Approach Advantages for Posts Functionality**

* **Optimized Performance:** Since posts are read far more often than written, separating read and write models allows optimizing each for their specific use. Reads can be fast and scalable, while writes can focus on business logic.
* **Scalability:** The system can independently scale read operations (which are the majority) and write operations, improving responsiveness under heavy user load.
* **Maintainability:** Separation of concerns simplifies managing complex logic for writing posts (such as updating multiple tables) and complicated read queries (with many joins).
* **Better User Experience:** Quick reads provide a smooth user experience for news feeds or post browsing, which are critical for social media engagement.
* **Supports Complex Business Logic:** The write side can handle complex validation and workflows without impacting read performance.
* **Better System Design:** Clear separation of command and query responsibilities simplifies complex business logic on the write side while allowing highly performant, tailored read models.

#### 2. **CQRS Approach Disadvantages for Profile Functionality**

* **Increased Complexity:** Developing and maintaining two separate models (read and write) requires more effort and expertise.
* **Eventual Consistency:** Reads may not immediately reflect writes due to synchronization delays between the write and read stores, potentially causing temporary data inconsistency.
* **Infrastructure Overhead:** More components such as event handlers, synchronization logic, and possibly separate databases increase deployment and operational complexity.
* **Steeper Learning Curve:** Developers need to understand CQRS and its implications, which can slow down development initially.
* **Overengineering for Simple Use Cases:** In the case of profile management, which involves relatively infrequent updates and simple read/write logic, applying CQRS adds unnecessary complexity. A traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach would be more appropriate, offering simplicity, immediate consistency, and ease of maintenance.

### Summary

* For **posts**, CQRS provides significant benefits by handling heavy read loads and complex write logic separately, enabling better performance and scalability.
* For **profiles**, the simplicity and low usage make traditional CRUD more practical, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
* CQRS is **not a silver bullet** — while it can be highly effective in systems with clearly separated read/write concerns, its use should be justified based on actual needs. Applying CQRS indiscriminately to every operation can lead to unnecessary overhead and maintenance complexity.
* CQRS also becomes especially meaningful when paired with **Event Sourcing**, where system state is managed through a series of domain events, making the separation of command and query sides more natural and powerful.
